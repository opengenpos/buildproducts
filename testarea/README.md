### 32 bit totals vs 64 bit totals

Builds previous to Rel 2.3.2.001 are the original 32 bit totals.

Builds from Rel 2.3.2.001 and later are the new 64 bit totals. The PCIF for 64 bit totals was changed to allow
for 64 bit numbers as was the PLU totals database interface. This means that you must use the correct version
of PEP and PCSample with a particular release.
